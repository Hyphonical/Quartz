# Server Rules

At Void Tales, our rules are the foundation of a welcoming and adventurous community. By following these guidelines, you help ensure the realm remains a safe, fun, and magical place for all.

ðŸ”¹ Respect the Realm â€“ Treat fellow adventurers with kindness. No harassment, hate speech, or toxicity shall take root here.

ðŸ”¹ Keep the Lore Intact â€“  Try to avoid spoilers outside the proper channels. Let every traveler uncover the world at their own pace.

ðŸ”¹ Honor the Elders â€“ Listen to the moderators and respect their guidance. They are the keepers of balance.

ðŸ”¹ The Rift Must Remain Sealed â€“ No NSFW, illegal content, or anything that threatens the safety of this realm.

ðŸ”¹ Let the Echoes Be Heard â€“ Feedback and suggestions are welcome, but keep them constructive and respectful.

ðŸ”¹ One Soul, One Form â€“ No impersonation, no alternate accounts for deceitful purposes. Stay true to your name.

Break the code, and the Void may claim you...
